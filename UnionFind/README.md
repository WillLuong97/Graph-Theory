# Union Find

## Deinition: 

- Union find or also known as Disjoin set, is a data structure that keep track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint or non-overlapping subsets. A union-find algorithm is used to find an algorithm that performs two main operations: 
	+ Find:  Determine which subsets a particular element is in. This can be used for determining if two elements are in the same subsets 
	+ Union: Join two subsets into a single subset. 

- Union find algorithm can be used to check whether an undirected graph contains cycle or not. 
- Union-find: this method assume that the graph does not have any self-loops.
